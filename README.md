**MAJI NDOGO PROJECT**

**Project description**
The project's main aim is to solve the water crisis in Maji Ndogo. 
This is first done by getting to know the data and figuring out the different types of water sources.
The quality of the water sources is assessed and the sources of water that are frequently visited are noted.
An investigation of any pollution issue is done on the water sources to know whether the sources of water are contaminated.
A survey was done and the project aims to understand the total number of people surveyed, 
and the number of water sources that are available and how many people share particular types of water sources on average.
The number of people served by each water source is also determined.
After the problems are identified, queries that allow for fixing the water sources that affect most people first are written. 
The queries are to rank each type of water source based on how many people in total use it. Rank() should tell us that we will need 
a window function to do this.
Average queue times in water sources are also determined.

Assessment of the quality of water sources is done and investigation pollution issues is done to determine the pollution levels of the water sources and categorised as 
biological or chemical contamination.


Conducting an independent audit of the Maju Ndogo water project of
Maji Ndogo water project, specifically the database recording water sources in the country
In this specific audit, our objective was to assess the integrity, and accuracy of the data stored in the database and to identify corrupt officers.
Here, JOINS, VIEWS, CTEs, were used to identify the corrupt officials.

***Examples of how the queries were used***

JOINS - To join certain columns of tables to extract desired information that would help in determining corrupt officials

VIEWS - To convert the joined tables into a view for easier readability

CTEs - To ensure readability and reusability of the codes, the CTEs also simplified the queries as they grew larger.

*Last phase*
In this phase, the data was shaped to provide meaningful views - providing essential information to decision-makers. This
will enable discernment of the materials needed, to plan budgets, and identify the areas requiring immediate attention.

**Insights**

1. Most water sources are rural.
2. 43% of our people are using shared taps. 2000 people often share one tap.
3. 31% of our population has water infrastructure in their homes, but within that group, 45% face non-functional systems due to issues with pipes,
pumps, and reservoirs.
4. 18% of our people are using wells of which, but within that, only 28% are clean..
5. Our citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than 120 minutes.
6. In terms of queues:
- Queues are very long on Saturdays.
- Queues are longer in the mornings and evenings.
- Wednesdays and Sundays have the shortest queues
